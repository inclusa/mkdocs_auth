# mkdocs basic authentication

An static site generador like [mkdocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/) is great for writing documentation.  Sometimes the information is not secret but we don't want it available to general public. Here's a workaround for such scenarios.

This solution adds basic authentication the pages generated by mkdocs. It renames static html files as php files and adds php code which provides the basic authentication functionality.

# tl;dr

* setup credentials in the `mkdocs.yml` file.
* add php code to `base.html` template file (if other than the readthedocs theme).
* write some docs.
* run `make full` and check the results.

# configuration

Mkdocs permits modifying the current theme by using the `theme\_dir` variable in the `mkdocs.yml` configuration file. New files will be added to the site's theme, while existing files will be overwritten.

```
theme_dir: theme_addons
```

The user/password credentials are also defined in the `mkdocs.yml` file.

```
extra:
  username: "admin"
  password: "secret"
```

# usage

```
git clone
cd $_
make full
```

The `readthedocs` is used, for another theme, make sure to use the right `base.html` template file with the php code added.

```
cp $(theme="$(egrep "^theme" mkdocs.yml| cut -f2 -d:)" ; locate base.html | grep $theme) theme_addons/
```

Check the `Makefile` file for the actual commands.
