# mkdocs basic authentication

An static site generador like [mkdocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/) is great for writing documentation.  Sometimes the information is not secret but we don't want it available to general public. Here's a workaround for such scenarios.

This solution adds basic authentication the pages generated by mkdocs. It renames static html files as php files and adds php code which provides the basic authentication functionality.

# tl;dr

* setup credentials in the `mkdocs.yml` file.
* add php code to `base.html` template file (if other than the readthedocs theme).
* write some docs.
* run `make full` and check the results.

# configuration

Mkdocs permits modifying the current theme by using the `theme_dir` variable in the `mkdocs.yml` configuration file. New files will be added to the site's theme, while existing files will be overwritten.

```
theme_dir: theme_addons
```

The user/password credentials are also defined in the `mkdocs.yml` file.

```
extra:
  username: "admin"
  password: "secret"
```

# usage

```
git clone git@github.com:otsuarez/mkdocs_auth.git
cd mkdocs_auth
pip install -r requirements.txt
make full
```

Open in your browser [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/).

## using a container

```
docker run -p 8080:8080 --rm -it ubuntu:artful bin/bash
apt update -y
apt install -y git  build-essential python-pip php
cd root
git clone https://github.com/otsuarez/mkdocs_auth.git
cd mkdocs_auth
pip install -r requirements.txt
make full
```

# other themes

The `readthedocs` theme is being used, for another theme, make sure to have the right `base.html` template file with the php code added.

```
cp $(theme="$(egrep "^theme" mkdocs.yml| cut -f2 -d:)" ; locate base.html | grep $theme) theme_addons/
```

Check the `Makefile` file for the actual commands.
